# TODO-LIST
# A simple task management App written with Flask 

# The app can be run in the following order in your terminal after cloning:
    pipenv install #this is if you are using a virtual environment if not "pip install"
    export FLASK_APP=app
    export FLASK_DEBUG=True #to allow debugging
    flask run

# To create the sqlite db, in your terminal run:
    python3 init_db #the python cmd depends on your python 3 alias
